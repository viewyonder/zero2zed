## Context

*Who TF?*

I'm writing this to help me learn Zed and many other other things: asking questions, documenting, and trying to explain stuff is how I learn. The secondary beneficiary are as yet unknown Dear Readers.

*Why TF?*

I started using Zed on the brink of starting a bunch of projects (is that the collective noun for projects?), and I'm finding myself using VScode more and more... and it's becoming proper crufty... and confusing... and I wanted to reset. I've tried most IDEs over the 30 years (sob) but a fresh kid on the block tickled my interest: Zed.

So, as an average programmer (I'm more a CTO type with 30 years experience doing all sorts) who has never used Zed and has a load of Python, LLM, and other projects to do: Zed it is.

*What TF?*

I hate doing any tech without at least reading some of the docs, finding people that are part of the project, and finding other user blogs and articles. So step one was to read docs which I share and index.

Then, I have some projects which I will add as I go along.

1. The first was a simple ClaudeAI test using Python and Anthropic.
2. More projects will be added, as I'm looking into Claude MCP, other APIs, and Agents.
3. How to communicate this stuff.
4. How to apply it to business (not just tech folks).

So the rest of this is, for now, just an index of resources I found. I will update the README as I add more found resources and projects I do.

# Ideas to include

Here's my rough n00b brainstorm of stuff to do to learn Zed through doing projects, and sharing.

This isn't a table of contents for this doc: it's a ToC for what was in my brain before I started!

1. Include X users who are helpful.
2. Find blogs that are helpful and NOT behind paywalls.
3. Draw a little tree of useful Zed online resources.
4. Draw a little tree of “happy path” useful Zed functions and features. Maybe colour code and beginner -> intermediate -> advanced?
5. Compare and contrast to VScode and Neovim (is it in the middle?)
6. Just link to install, don’t repeat (it’s easy).
7. Quick concierge tour of the IDE.
8. Extensions?
9. Set up for Python?
10. Set up with Claude IDE?
11. Markdown?
12. Set up for Github?
13. Set up on your laptop (local file structure – use a cloud service like iCloud).
14. Project examples?
15. Video content?
16. What blogs to write?
17. Create an all-on-one markdown file?
18. Schedule regular posts on X/LinkedIn.
19. Reddit group? https://www.reddit.com/r/ZedEditor/
